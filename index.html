              <h3>5 &#11088;</h3>
              <p>"I was calling around to find a brow salon open on Thanksgiving. Luckily, I found this place. 
                I had friendly service with a smile when I entered and I was sat down immediately. The salon is very clean, quiet, and peaceful. 
                I asked for a brow wax, and she asked if a little bit of threading was okay after the wax. I had no pain at all my whole experience! 
                She took time to shape them perfectly and my sensitive skin has absolutely no damage (sometimes I swell or scab when I get my brows done). 
                She was very knowledgeable about hair removal and skin care. My visit was worth the drive! 
                I had better service/results here than at salons that charge $20+ for brows. I plan to return in a few weeks!"</p>

              <p>"Amazing browz & beauty is my #1 place to go from now on. I am blown away my eyebrows have never looked this good. 
                I had my whole face threaded and I usually donâ€™t let any touch my eyebrows. 
                I decided to give this place a chance and I was not disappointed. I will be returning every month. 10/10 experience. 
                No wait and great prices!"</p>

              <p>"I have been looking for a new place to get my eyebrows threaded; it seems lately I have not had any luck. 
                Until I found this place. I noticed right away, that she held relationships with her clients and knew them by name. 
                Which was a great sign for me! Returning customers!</p>

              <p>So I explained to her what I wanted, and what I experienced, and she did a wonderful job! 
                I will be back- eyebrows are important to me, and I want them to be perfect.. and she definitely did that!"</p>

              <p>"I went to get my eyebrows threaded and tinted. I was greeted with a very friendly woman. 
                She knew exactly what she was doing. She shaped my eyebrows perfectly and tinted them nicely. 
                Was a very quick service but also high-quality as well. Highly recommend. This will be my go-to spot from now on for my brows."</p>
